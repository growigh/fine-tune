For almost a decade, holograms have been a marketing gimmick. But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world. Let me explain. So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space, you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view. Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal. One you can peer around, lean into or walk past. You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses, while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head. Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images, one for each eye, sync to your exact head position. The result, realtime motion parallax and depth. Lean left and you see behind the virtual object. Crouch and you're looking under it. Recently, they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal. It almost looks like a sand table, but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city.

According to data from DD, the biggest tech companies, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Nvidia, and Palanteer have had zero net growth in hiring over the last 3 years. That's right, zero growth. The total headcount today is basically the same as it was 3 years ago. So, what exactly is happening during the pandemic? These companies went on a massive hiring spree. Just look at this graph. That huge spike in 2022, that's when they collectively added over 120,000 employees in a single year. But then in 2023, we actually saw negative growth with companies cutting jobs. But the big question is, how are these tech giants growing their businesses without growing their teams? It boils down to these four fundamental changes. First, they overhired during the zero interest rate pandemic years between 2020 and 2022, assuming the demand boom would continue long-term. It did not. Second, with higher interest rates now, CFOs are under intense pressure to improve operating margins, and keeping headcount flat is the most direct way to boost those numbers. Third, these companies are investing billions in generative AI infrastructure. The cost of capital for these chips and systems is enormous, leaving less budget for new hires. Fourth, there's emerging evidence that AI productivity tools might already be enabling these companies to accomplish more with their existing workforce. This last point is actually huge because it's changing a fundamental relationship in business. The data historically showed that if a company's revenue grew by 10%, its headcount would also grow by about 10%. But these AI productivity gains are breaking that pattern. Now these tech leaders are testing whether they can grow revenue without growing headcount at all. This represents the potential end of the hyperrowth hiring era that defined tech from 2010 to 2021."}]}

But instead of Vader saying something serious like he usually does, he says something totally unexpected. So, how did this happen? Well, it's because Epic Games added characters like Darth Vader using AI so players could interact with them. According to Fortnite's website, when players talk to Darth Vader, their voice gets converted into text and fed into Google's Gemini, which writes a reply matching Darth Vader's personality. Then 11 Labs, a texttovoice model, takes that reply and speaks it out loud in Vader's voice. Now, that's what should have happened ideally, but players quickly realized that by asking Vader to repeat after me or using clever replies, they could bypass Fortnite's filters and trick Gemini into saying almost anything they want. In other words, they weren't exactly hacking the system, but manipulating Gemini by finding loopholes in how LLM understand language. While this might be funny to some, remember that Fortnite is played by millions of kids as well, and pre-exposing them to such stuff probably isn't good for them. Epic Games says they've now fixed the issue with a hot fix and added more safety checks. Like, if a player is under 13, they cannot talk to these AI characters without parental consent.

Fortnite might finally be coming back. So, it all started in 2008 when Apple launched the App Store and introduced a 30% commission on almost everything sold through the app. Subscriptions, game purchases, inapp upgrades, you name it. And to be fair, it made sense, too. After all, Apple was offering a massive marketplace and helping developers make millions. But as the app economy exploded, developers started getting frustrated with Apple's 30% cut. So, they found a clever trick. They'd used the app store to get traction, but then nudge users to their own websites to make the payments. This meant that Apple could no longer get its cut, something Apple did not tolerate. So, they started blocking developers from telling users about cheaper payment options outside the app. Now, when this reached the court, Apple was forced to allow developers to redirect users again. But this is where Apple did something sneaky. Yes, the developers could now redirect users to external links, but Apple would still charge a 27% cut since Apple believed it facilitated the transaction. And that's where Epic Games stepped in. They did something nobody would even dare of doing against Apple. They built their own inapp payment system called Epic Direct Payment inside Fortnite, bypassing Apple completely within the app itself. So, in classic Apple fashion, Fortnite was kicked off the app store immediately, and thus began the iconic Epic Games versus Apple lawsuit. Epic argued Apple was abusing its monopoly, while Apple said it was just protecting its users. But after years of constant back and forth, Epic Games finally won on April 30th, 2025, and they won big. So big that Fortnite might eventually be coming back. Even though Apple has filed an appeal against this contempt ruling last week, Epic's win could change everything for developers. With Apple no longer taking its cut, developers can finally build apps without worrying about losing a third of their revenue, eventually motivating more indie developers to build apps."}]}

It all starts with a tiny coinsized chip placed inside Brad's motor cortex, the part of the brain responsible for movement. Now, from this chip, about 1,024 ultra thin electrodes are inserted directly into the soft jelly-like brain matter, carefully listening to individual neurons. Now, every time Brad thinks about something, like moving his tongue or clenching his jaw, specific neurons activate. The electrodes then pick up this neural activity and send it to the chip where an AI decodes these signals and turns Brad's thoughts into precise cursor movements and clicks. What's mind-blowing is how this entire process happens every 15 milliseconds, which is as real time as it gets. But Brad didn't use it to just click around. He edited an entire video, dragging files, navigating menus, trimming clips, picking transitions, and even fine-tuning the timeline using nothing but his thoughts and an AI clone of his voice. What's even more impressive is that unlike eyetracking systems that don't work in bright light, Neuralink works anywhere. It doesn't care if you're indoors, outdoors, sitting, lying down. It just listens to your brain. That's it. And this is just the beginning. Imagine a future where two people could talk without even saying a word. where you could just think about something and the decoded signals could be sent directly to another person's implant and stimulate the right neurons, transmitting ideas directly with near zero information loss.

They analyzed the person's entire Reddit posting history to figure out their age, gender, location, political beliefs, and even their likes and dislikes based on their profile.

Spanning over 81,000 m, this dark factory operates completely autonomously with no lights, no shifts, and no humans. But how? Well, all thanks to Xiaomi's AI powered manufacturing system called Hyper Intelligent Manufacturing Platform or Hyper IMP. You see, most factories run on static automation. That means each machine is programmed only once and it performs only one specific task over and over again and that works fine until something goes wrong, a misalignment or a sensor glitch and suddenly the machines don't know how to handle it and need humans to fix it. But Xiaomi's factory is different. The machines aren't just following instructions. They're also training a central AI system called HyperMP by sending real-time data. The AI system then uses this data to constantly analyze every machine in the factory. And if something seems off, it goes ahead and fixes it without any human involvement. But this isn't about Xiaomi cranking out a new phone every second. It's about a much bigger shift happening in China. China has cracked the code on something far more powerful, automation at scale. People think of China as a country of cheap labor. But what they don't realize is that it's not because Chinese factories are filled with lowcost workers. It's because those factories have now become completely automated and are being run almost entirely by robots. And this is the kind of automation that changes how a country innovates. China isn't using robots just to make things quicker, but to free up human time so people can stop doing repetitive work and focus on R&D, innovation, and improving technology."}]}

The planet, its star, and the James Webb Space Telescope all align perfectly in a straight line. And when that happens, a small amount of starlight passes directly through the planet's atmosphere and reaches here on Earth. But when scientists analyzed this starlight, they noticed something strange. Some tiny chunks of the light spectrum were missing, as if someone had completely erased them. Turns out, some gases present in K28B's atmosphere had absorbed light at specific wavelengths. And by carefully studying which wavelengths were missing, scientists identified exactly which gases were present in the atmosphere. And what they found was fascinating. They detected dimethyl sulfide or DMS, a gas that is only produced by living organisms on Earth. Even more compelling, they found dimethyl dulfide and methane, which are strongly linked to underwater creatures. This means that K218b isn't just another planet. It's a planet with a thick hydrogen-rich atmosphere and a massive ocean covering the entire planet. Kind of like Miller's planet from Interstellar, but real.

It's the Tesla of clean air, and it's changing the game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This company is the Tesla of clean air. When I heard about it, I didn't believe it. So, I had to go and check it out. When we talk about air pollution, we usually think of Delhi hitting 1,000 AQI and people wearing masks outdoors. But here's something wild. There are places in India with AQI readings above 100,000. I'm talking about factories where many of the materials for our everyday products like steel, cement, spices, fertilizers, colors, pharmaceuticals, etc. are made. While news headlines focus on urban pollution, what's happening inside these factories is way more extreme. Some industrial environments have particulate levels 20,000 times what the WHO considers safe. And more than 100 million people work in these environments every day. And these aren't just random facilities. They're major production centers making things we use every day. I recently visited a company called Pran where they made me experience this high pollution. They've built a test chamber that simulates factory conditions. And when they cranked it up to 10,000 AQI, the air turned into a thick cloud I could barely see through. But here's the cool part. When they switched on their air purification system, the MK2, the readings dropped below 100 in minutes and the cloud completely disappeared and all the material was then captured in their device in its raw form. This extreme pollution creates real problems. Workers showed 26% higher absentism. Valuable raw materials literally float away as dust in pharmaceutical factories. That's ingredients worth lacks per kilogram and machinery lifespan drops by up to 40%. So, how is PR tackling this massive challenge? They've developed a revolutionary filtration system specifically designed for these ultra high pollution environments. Unlike traditional industrial filters that clog quickly and require constant replacement, PR technology is filterless. That is, it has no filters. And it can handle particulate levels all the way to 100,000 micrograms per cubic meter without stopping production. The coolest part, the system doesn't just capture the particles, it can actually recover valuable materials that would otherwise be lost. In one pigment factory, they're now reclaiming expensive powders worth lacks every day which otherwise disappear into the air. But one of the biggest challenges in implementing these is that each factory is unique. Their materials are unique and so are their pollution dynamics. To solve this, Pran has created its own computer vision system that creates a digital twin of the factory and autosolves the air pollution using AI models they've developed themselves. So what would take a team of engineers 1 to 6 months to get done, PR's AI does in 24 hours. And to make sure these solutions reach everywhere, PR has miniaturaturized their filterless technology so that these MK2 air purification systems are plugandplay. One day the factories struggle with dust problems and the next day they don't. And not just that, each MK2 system creates a real-time environmental and deficiency map for the shop floor, helping companies actually track their environmental conditions as well as material recovery. What's exciting is that some of the largest global companies are already working with brand to implement these across their factories in India. This isn't just about cleaner air or protecting workers. It's about building factories of global standards right here in India by recovering resources, measuring environmental parameters, and making the manufacturing process more efficient. I can't wait to see technologies like these elevate the standards at which manufacturing facilities operate forever."}]}

Create perfect images instantly in your chat!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OpenAI just launched a new tool that lets you create perfect images and infographics right in your chat. I actually used it to create some UIUX designs myself and the results are pretty good. It understood exactly what I needed for app interface mockups and generated them instantly. That means the same model you're already chatting with can now create highquality visuals without switching to another tool. And check this out. If you need a diagram explaining Newton's prism experiment, you just describe what you want and it generates it right there in your conversation. The images are incredibly detailed with accurate light, shadow, and texture. But what's really impressive is how accurately it handles text in images. Mathematical equations, labels on diagrams, and even full paragraphs come out perfectly legible. Now, OpenAI has finally cracked one of the biggest challenges in AI image generation. Creating images with clear, accurate text that doesn't look warped or gibberish. And there's so much customization. You can specify exact colors with hex codes. Choose precise aspect ratios and select different image styles to match exactly what you need. Plus, it also maintains context from your conversation. If you have been discussing physics concepts, it'll incorporate that understanding into your visual without you having to reexlain everything. How cool is that? It's already rolling out to free plus team and pro users with enterprise and edu versions coming soon. Pro users can even run four generations simultaneously. I love it when technology makes powerful creative tools more accessible. Instead of these capabilities being limited to designers with expensive software, now anyone can create clear, informative visuals just by describing what they"}]}
