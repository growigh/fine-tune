    "output": "This technology from Star Wars just became real. For almost a decade, holograms have been a marketing gimmick. But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world. Let me explain. So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space, you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view. Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal. One you can peer around, lean into or walk past. You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses, while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head. Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images, one for each eye, sync to your exact head position. The result, realtime motion parallax and depth. Lean left and you see behind the virtual object. Crouch and you're looking under it. Recently, they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal. It almost looks like a sand table, but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city. Now, with the speed technologies moving, I don't think we're far away from actually stepping inside virtual cities or maybe even playing Age of Empires on the table against our"},

This is something which blew my [Music] mind. As you can see, the translation happens instantly. The glasses can understand multiple languages and show you what's being said right in your field of view. This could completely change how we communicate across language barriers. Now, what makes these special is that they combine cameras, microphones, speakers, and a hidden display that only you can see. Google built these with Samsung and Qualcomm, creating a new Android XR platform that's designed to work perfectly with your phone. Plus, with Gemini AI built-in, the glasses can see what you're looking at and provide helpful information right when you need it. They understand your location and which way you're facing, so directions appear exactly when and where you need them.

Now, Google is going allin on AI that is more intelligent, agentic, and personalized than ever before. First, they're improving their most intelligent models. Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro are getting major upgrades. The standout is Deep Think, a new enhanced reasoning mode in Gemini 2.5 Pro that can tackle super complex math and coding tasks through parallel thinking. Next up, Gemini powered agents are next level this year. Project Mariner can now juggle up to 10 tasks at once, learns workflows after you teach it just once, and powers the new agent mode inside the Gemini app. Think finding apartments, booking tours, or handling forms automatically. Plus, what's really cool is you'll soon be able to shop with AI, including virtually trying on clothes from your own photos with just a single upload. They're also launching impressive generative media models. Imagine 4 creates stunning images with better text rendering. While V3 is the first video model with native audio generation, adding environmental sounds and even dialogue to videos. Now, Google is also introducing Flow, a new AI filmmaking tool designed specifically for their advanced models that helps storytellers create cinematic clips and scenes without complicated production. For developers, Jules is now available in public beta. It's an asynchronous coding agent that integrates directly with repositories and handles tasks on your behalf. Then we have Android XR which is bringing Gemini to glasses and headsets. These smart glasses come with cameras, microphones, and an optional inland lens display working with your phone to give you hands-free AI assistance. Google is partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster to make stylish versions. Finally, let's not forget Beam, previously called Project Starline. This AI first 3D video communication platform creates remarkably lielike conversations with speech translation capabilities. You see, I was at Google IO again this time and got my hands on some of these tools and demos. Trust me, this isn't just incremental progress."},

    "output": "Have you noticed it's gotten way harder to land a tech job as a fresher? According to data from DD, the biggest tech companies, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Nvidia, and Palanteer have had zero net growth in hiring over the last 3 years. That's right, zero growth. The total headcount today is basically the same as it was 3 years ago. So, what exactly is happening during the pandemic? These companies went on a massive hiring spree. Just look at this graph. That huge spike in 2022, that's when they collectively added over 120,000 employees in a single year. But then in 2023, we actually saw negative growth with companies cutting jobs. But the big question is, how are these tech giants growing their businesses without growing their teams? It boils down to these four fundamental changes. First, they overhired during the zero interest rate pandemic years between 2020 and 2022, assuming the demand boom would continue long-term. It did not. Second, with higher interest rates now, CFOs are under intense pressure to improve operating margins, and keeping headcount flat is the most direct way to boost those numbers. Third, these companies are investing billions in generative AI infrastructure. The cost of capital for these chips and systems is enormous, leaving less budget for new hires. Fourth, there's emerging evidence that AI productivity tools might already be enabling these companies to accomplish more with their existing workforce. This last point is actually huge because it's changing a fundamental relationship in business. The data historically showed that if a company's revenue grew by 10%, its headcount would also grow by about 10%. But these AI productivity gains are breaking that pattern. Now these tech leaders are testing whether they can grow revenue without growing headcount at all. This represents the potential end of the hyperrowth hiring era that defined tech from 2010 to 2021."},

Explain this adolescent term. Now, we can't tell you what it means for obvious reasons, but it shows Peter Griffin holding a lightsaber and facing off with Darth Vader. But instead of Vader saying something serious like he usually does, he says something totally unexpected. So, how did this happen? Well, it's because Epic Games added characters like Darth Vader using AI so players could interact with them. According to Fortnite's website, when players talk to Darth Vader, their voice gets converted into text and fed into Google's Gemini, which writes a reply matching Darth Vader's personality. Then 11 Labs, a texttovoice model, takes that reply and speaks it out loud in Vader's voice. Now, that's what should have happened ideally, but players quickly realized that by asking Vader to repeat after me or using clever replies, they could bypass Fortnite's filters and trick Gemini into saying almost anything they want. In other words, they weren't exactly hacking the system, but manipulating Gemini by finding loopholes in how LLM understand language. While this might be funny to some, remember that Fortnite is played by millions of kids as well, and pre-exposing them to such stuff probably isn't good for them. Epic Games says they've now fixed the issue with a hot fix and added more safety checks. Like, if a player is under 13, they cannot talk to these AI characters without parental consent.

    "output": "OpenAI just launched Codeex, a software engineering agent that runs in the cloud and does tasks for you, like writing a new feature or fixing a bug. You can even run multiple tasks in parallel, each in its own isolated environment. You can access Codeex through chat GPT sidebar and assign new coding tasks by typing a prompt and clicking code. If you want to ask Codeex a question about your codebase, click ask. Each task is processed independently in a separate isolated environment pre-loaded with your codebase. Technically, Codeex is powered by Codeex 1, a specialized model built on OpenAI's 03 architecture, but optimized specifically for software engineering. It can perform tasks in real time by reading your codebase, creating changes in a sandboxed environment, running tests to verify its work, and then preparing pull requests. The system works by preloading your repository into an isolated container where Codeex can execute commands, modify files, and validate changes through your existing test suite. There's no internet access during execution, just your code and pre-installed dependencies. What's fascinating is how teams are already using it. Companies like Cisco and Temporal are offloading repetitive tasks like refactoring and test writing, while superhuman found it's helping product managers contribute lightweight code changes without pulling engineers away from core work. What's interesting is how Codex is solving two problems at once. It's reducing context switching for developers and automating background work that would otherwise break focus. It's available now for chat GPT pro team and enterprise users with support for plus users coming soon. This tech represents a significant shift in how we approach software development from pure human coding to human AI collaboration."},

The epic Apple vs. Epic Games battle is finally over, and it could change everything for app developers.  Find out how!", 
    "output": "Apple has finally listened to developers and the Apple tax is going away. And guess what? Fortnite might finally be coming back. So, it all started in 2008 when Apple launched the App Store and introduced a 30% commission on almost everything sold through the app. Subscriptions, game purchases, inapp upgrades, you name it. And to be fair, it made sense, too. After all, Apple was offering a massive marketplace and helping developers make millions. But as the app economy exploded, developers started getting frustrated with Apple's 30% cut. So, they found a clever trick. They'd used the app store to get traction, but then nudge users to their own websites to make the payments. This meant that Apple could no longer get its cut, something Apple did not tolerate. So, they started blocking developers from telling users about cheaper payment options outside the app. Now, when this reached the court, Apple was forced to allow developers to redirect users again. But this is where Apple did something sneaky. Yes, the developers could now redirect users to external links, but Apple would still charge a 27% cut since Apple believed it facilitated the transaction. And that's where Epic Games stepped in. They did something nobody would even dare of doing against Apple. They built their own inapp payment system called Epic Direct Payment inside Fortnite, bypassing Apple completely within the app itself. So, in classic Apple fashion, Fortnite was kicked off the app store immediately, and thus began the iconic Epic Games versus Apple lawsuit. Epic argued Apple was abusing its monopoly, while Apple said it was just protecting its users. But after years of constant back and forth, Epic Games finally won on April 30th, 2025, and they won big. So big that Fortnite might eventually be coming back. Even though Apple has filed an appeal against this contempt ruling last week, Epic's win could change everything for developers. With Apple no longer taking its cut, developers can finally build apps without worrying about losing a third of their revenue, eventually motivating more indie developers to build apps."},

    "output": "You're looking at the first ever video edited using only thoughts. This is the first video edited with the Neuralink. This is my old voice narrating this video cloned by AI from recordings before I lost my voice. This is Brad, an ALS patient who can't move or speak, but can somehow control his MacBook using just his thoughts thanks to Neuralink. It all starts with a tiny coinsized chip placed inside Brad's motor cortex, the part of the brain responsible for movement. Now, from this chip, about 1,024 ultra thin electrodes are inserted directly into the soft jelly-like brain matter, carefully listening to individual neurons. Now, every time Brad thinks about something, like moving his tongue or clenching his jaw, specific neurons activate. The electrodes then pick up this neural activity and send it to the chip where an AI decodes these signals and turns Brad's thoughts into precise cursor movements and clicks. What's mind-blowing is how this entire process happens every 15 milliseconds, which is as real time as it gets. But Brad didn't use it to just click around. He edited an entire video, dragging files, navigating menus, trimming clips, picking transitions, and even fine-tuning the timeline using nothing but his thoughts and an AI clone of his voice. What's even more impressive is that unlike eyetracking systems that don't work in bright light, Neuralink works anywhere. It doesn't care if you're indoors, outdoors, sitting, lying down. It just listens to your brain. That's it. And this is just the beginning. Imagine a future where two people could talk without even saying a word. where you could just think about something and the decoded signals could be sent directly to another person's implant and stimulate the right neurons, transmitting ideas directly with near zero information loss. It's both exciting and scary to think about how human communication will evolve in the coming decades."},

    "output": "The CIA has openly posted a job for their plan to hire Chinese spies. Now, it all started quietly in October 2024 when the CIA began posting subtle recruitment tips online, targeting people in China and Iran to come work secretly with the US. They even gave detailed instructions like avoid using home or work computers, delete search history, and even told people to use tour browsers to hide their identity and location. But this time, they took it to the extreme by posting documentary style videos in Mandarin, telling people to contact them securely and that they'll help you leave. The videos even pulled in over 5 million views in just 24 hours, proving this strategy might even be working. And the videos aren't made for just anyone. It's specifically targeted at two very specific groups. First, it's for older Chinese officials who are scared of the government and worried they might suddenly go missing like their colleagues. And second, for young government workers trapped in boring, meaningless jobs with no way to escape. Now whether these people actually reach out to the CIA or not, a good question to ask is why is the CIA even trying to hire these people in the first place? Is it to rescue them? Or are they trying to extract secret information about China? Or maybe all this is psychology and the CIA just wants to stir things up, create drama, and make Chinese people start looking at each other with suspicion. We don't know much for sure, but what we do know is that the Chinese media might secretly be watching everything even though they haven't said anything yet. What do you think?"},

They analyzed the person's entire Reddit posting history to figure out their age, gender, location, political beliefs, and even their likes and dislikes based on their profile. Sometimes the AI even crafted elaborate fake personas. One AI accused members of a religious group of causing the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders, farmers, and villagers. Another posed as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse. One AI even claimed to be a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter. The Reddit moderators discovered this experiment after the fact and were furious. They filed an ethics complaint with the university, arguing that people come to their forum to engage with other humans, not to be unwitting subjects in an AI experiment. This connects to what some refer to as the dead internet theory. The notion that increasingly our online interactions may be with AI bots rather than real humans. As these bots become more sophisticated and widespread, how will we know who or what we're really talking to? I find this both fascinating and deeply unsettling. Technology is amazing, but we need transparency about who's behind the screen. Could you tell if you were debating with an AI all along?"},

    "output": "Elon Musk claims that robots will surpass the best human surgeons within just 5 years. And guess what? The data seems to support him. A company called Medronic recently tested their Hugo robot in about 137 real surgeries fixing prostates, kidneys, and bladders. And the results were astonishing. With a 98.5% success rate and complication rates as low as 3.7%, the robot didn't just exceed the 85% goal, but set a new benchmark for robot assisted surgeries. What's more impressive is that only two out of 137 surgeries needed to switch back to regular surgery. One because of a robot glitch and the other because of a complicated patient case. And this isn't the only case where robots outshined humans. Elon claims Neuralink had to use a robot for brain computer electrode insertion as it was impossible for a human to achieve the required speed and precision. But here's the thing, these robots aren't fully autonomous yet. They don't act on their own. Surgeries are still done using something called RA or robot assisted surgery where a human surgeon controls the robot's arms through a console. This means that the surgeons are still in control and make all the decisions. It's just that these robots are really good at minimizing human errors like shaky hand movements or fatigue during long procedures, especially in delicate or hard-to-reach areas. So, while we might not be replacing human surgeons anytime soon, we're certainly heading towards a future where humans and robots will be working together to make surgeries more precise and safer."},

    "output": "What if I told you we've all been learning the wrong way? Throughout history, we've sort of known that the best way to learn isn't a classroom. It's actually personal tutoring. Now, AI tutoring might have finally solved the 40-year-old challenge known as the two sigma problem. But what exactly is the two sigma problem? Why is it such a big deal? Check out these three curves. The left one shows regular classroom learning. You know, one teacher trying to help 30 students at once. The middle one is when students have to fully grasp one topic before moving on to the next. The right curve shows what happens with one-on-one tutoring. The gap between regular classes and personal tutoring is huge. Scientists call this the two sigma effect. But what does that actually mean? It means the average student with a personal tutor suddenly performs better than almost all students in regular classes. We're talking about jumping from middle of the pack to top of the class just by changing how you learn. For 40 years, teachers have known this works. But there's an obvious problem. We can't give everyone their own personal tutor. It costs too much and we don't have enough tutors. But now, thanks to AI integrated directly into modern PCs like those equipped with Intel Core ultra processors, everyone can now have a personal tutor without breaking the bank and without technically needing an internet connection. Your computer itself becomes your personal tutor, instantly adapting lessons as you learn. And that's a game changer for India. Traditionally, the household PC was seen as a luxury or a gaming machine, not a study desk. But with AI baked right in, the same device is turning into the centerpiece of modern learning. So, one example is personalized learning where AI recognizes exactly where you're struggling and adjusts lessons specifically for you. Second is learning anywhere, even offline, so you never have to worry about connectivity issues. And then there's extended battery life that lasts all day, ideally for students who are constantly on the move between multiple classes and sessions. Whether you're working on lengthy assignments, doing quick revisions before a test, or simply reviewing an essay, an AI powered PC can transform the way you"},

    "output": "Google just created a digital insect, a fruit fly that lives inside your computer and walks, flies, and sees as if it's real. But how? Well, the team started by carefully creating the fly's body and built a highly detailed 3D model using mojo, a physics simulator. But a body needs a brain to function. So next, the team set out to build its brain and collected massive amounts of videos of real fruit flies and trained a special AI model, teaching it exactly how flies walk on table, make sharp turns mid-flight, or buzz through the air. Once trained, they let this brain control the fly's body in the simulator. And the result amazed everyone. It moved exactly like a real fly would, buzzing, turning, and adjusting its speed. What's crazy is that this digital fly could also see and respond to its surroundings by processing real-time visual inputs inside the simulator, something only real flies can do. But why even bother creating a digital fly? Well, think about its implications. If this tech holds up, we wouldn't need to subject animals to harmful experiments anymore. Instead, we could create digital animals like mice or zebra fish and run as many experiments as we want. Not just this, scientists could also use these digital animals and tweak different factors to understand how animal brains work and influence behavior. What do you think?"},

Spanning over 81,000 m, this dark factory operates completely autonomously with no lights, no shifts, and no humans. But how? Well, all thanks to Xiaomi's AI powered manufacturing system called Hyper Intelligent Manufacturing Platform or Hyper IMP. You see, most factories run on static automation. That means each machine is programmed only once and it performs only one specific task over and over again and that works fine until something goes wrong, a misalignment or a sensor glitch and suddenly the machines don't know how to handle it and need humans to fix it. But Xiaomi's factory is different. The machines aren't just following instructions. They're also training a central AI system called HyperMP by sending real-time data. The AI system then uses this data to constantly analyze every machine in the factory. And if something seems off, it goes ahead and fixes it without any human involvement. But this isn't about Xiaomi cranking out a new phone every second. It's about a much bigger shift happening in China. China has cracked the code on something far more powerful, automation at scale. People think of China as a country of cheap labor. But what they don't realize is that it's not because Chinese factories are filled with lowcost workers. It's because those factories have now become completely automated and are being run almost entirely by robots. And this is the kind of automation that changes how a country innovates. China isn't using robots just to make things quicker, but to free up human time so people can stop doing repetitive work and focus on R&D, innovation, and improving technology."},

Well, imagine a planet K218b in this case orbiting its star. Kind of like how Earth orbits the sun. Now, every 33 days, something special happens. The planet, its star, and the James Webb Space Telescope all align perfectly in a straight line. And when that happens, a small amount of starlight passes directly through the planet's atmosphere and reaches here on Earth. But when scientists analyzed this starlight, they noticed something strange. Some tiny chunks of the light spectrum were missing, as if someone had completely erased them. Turns out, some gases present in K28B's atmosphere had absorbed light at specific wavelengths. And by carefully studying which wavelengths were missing, scientists identified exactly which gases were present in the atmosphere. And what they found was fascinating. They detected dimethyl sulfide or DMS, a gas that is only produced by living organisms on Earth. Even more compelling, they found dimethyl dulfide and methane, which are strongly linked to underwater creatures. This means that K218b isn't just another planet. It's a planet with a thick hydrogen-rich atmosphere and a massive ocean covering the entire planet. Kind of like Miller's planet from Interstellar, but real.

My name is Manoj and I'm a call center agent from India. Clear communication is vital for my customers and me, but accent barriers can sometimes make it challenging. Let me show you the voice preservation mode in action. This mode keeps my original voice intact while softening challenging parts of my accent. It helps customers understand me better, improving satisfaction on both sides of the call. This mood allows me to stay authentic, making every interaction more personal and effective. Now, the AI operates through a virtual audio driver with just 200 milliseconds of latency. That's faster than the human perception of conversation. Plus, Crisp trained their AI on thousands of paired recordings of Indian English and American English speech patterns to make this possible. However, it preserves your unique voice characteristics while modifying the pronunciation and intonation patterns. It's essentially changing how you sound without altering your voice. Now, this tech is just weird, isn't it? It's like we're creating digital masks for our voices. Think about it. Your accent is part of your identity, your story, your culture, and now an AI can just strip that away in milliseconds. But what do you think about this?

While regular AI has to recheck everything it's done so far, super inefficient. TTT gives the AI a special notepad where it writes down important things about the story as it goes, helping it remember what happened 30 seconds ago when creating the next scene. The coolest part is how they tested it by creating Tom and Jerry cartoons. The researchers train their system on about 7 hours of Tom and Jerry content. The AI generates these videos completely from text descriptions and keeps the characters consistent throughout multiple scenes and camera angles. This technique is so promising because it could eventually help AI create even longer videos with more complex stories."},

Now, they'll have to pay the AI a lot, so they won't capture all of that. And also, the market price for a piece of code will go down, but I I would bet this is an example. Everyone seems obsessed with Jeban's paradox all of a sudden. I don't want to like dodge the question cuz I don't think it'll be like that in every industry, but code is one where I would guess it's like that. Now that we know everything we know, do you have a timeline for when a lot of writing code becomes English or is that not going to happen? I think it's the degree of automation that matters. is to get to a truly 100% automation. You can make a complex thing and never touch code.

[Music] Now, these ancient predators were reconstructed using DNA from fossils dating back 11,500 and 72,000 years. Technically, Colossal used crisper gene editing to recreate the genome, bridging the gap between ancient samples and modern wolves. The project has already resulted in three dire wolves with distinctive thick white fur that showcases characteristics scientists couldn't determine from fossils alone. Colossal's mission goes beyond reviving extinct species. It's about taking responsibility for Earth's biodiversity. As the company's CEO, Ben Lamb, explained on Joe Rogan's podcast, they're not just focused on dire wolves. They're also working on woolly mammoths, Tasmanian tigers, and the dodo.

What's crazy is that this AI assisted learning outperformed 80% of other educational programs and helped struggling students catch up. And it didn't stop there.

Students who participated in this 6E program continued to excel even in their end ofear exams, performing better across all subjects. But here's the challenge. While personalized learning is needed, in countries like India, only 57% of schools have a functional PC. That means millions of students are being left behind, especially now when AI is changing everything. And this isn't just about missing out on a device. It's about missing out on a 24/7 tutor that can provide instant explanations, real-time feedback, and personalized learning anytime, anywhere. For years, students have had to waste hours to understand concepts that could be explained in minutes, either by waiting for the next class or struggling through textbooks on their own. And while mobile devices can help, PCs are far better for practice. And that's where Intel's AI enabled PCs come in. Powered by Intel Core Ultra processors designed specially to handle the intensive processing AI requires, students can now run advanced AI models locally.

Get ready to see how they're making factories cleaner, more efficient, and more sustainable.", 
    "output": "This company is the Tesla of clean air. When I heard about it, I didn't believe it. So, I had to go and check it out. When we talk about air pollution, we usually think of Delhi hitting 1,000 AQI and people wearing masks outdoors. But here's something wild. There are places in India with AQI readings above 100,000. I'm talking about factories where many of the materials for our everyday products like steel, cement, spices, fertilizers, colors, pharmaceuticals, etc. are made. While news headlines focus on urban pollution, what's happening inside these factories is way more extreme. Some industrial environments have particulate levels 20,000 times what the WHO considers safe. And more than 100 million people work in these environments every day. And these aren't just random facilities. They're major production centers making things we use every day. I recently visited a company called Pran where they made me experience this high pollution. They've built a test chamber that simulates factory conditions. And when they cranked it up to 10,000 AQI, the air turned into a thick cloud I could barely see through. But here's the cool part. When they switched on their air purification system, the MK2, the readings dropped below 100 in minutes and the cloud completely disappeared and all the material was then captured in their device in its raw form. This extreme pollution creates real problems. Workers showed 26% higher absentism. Valuable raw materials literally float away as dust in pharmaceutical factories. That's ingredients worth lacks per kilogram and machinery lifespan drops by up to 40%. So, how is PR tackling this massive challenge? They've developed a revolutionary filtration system specifically designed for these ultra high pollution environments. Unlike traditional industrial filters that clog quickly and require constant replacement, PR technology is filterless. That is, it has no filters. And it can handle particulate levels all the way to 100,000 micrograms per cubic meter without stopping production. The coolest part, the system doesn't just capture the particles, it can actually recover valuable materials that would otherwise be lost. In one pigment factory, they're now reclaiming expensive powders worth lacks every day which otherwise disappear into the air. But one of the biggest challenges in implementing these is that each factory is unique. Their materials are unique and so are their pollution dynamics. To solve this, Pran has created its own computer vision system that creates a digital twin of the factory and autosolves the air pollution using AI models they've developed themselves. So what would take a team of engineers 1 to 6 months to get done, PR's AI does in 24 hours. And to make sure these solutions reach everywhere, PR has miniaturaturized their filterless technology so that these MK2 air purification systems are plugandplay. One day the factories struggle with dust problems and the next day they don't. And not just that, each MK2 system creates a real-time environmental and deficiency map for the shop floor, helping companies actually track their environmental conditions as well as material recovery. What's exciting is that some of the largest global companies are already working with brand to implement these across their factories in India. This isn't just about cleaner air or protecting workers. It's about building factories of global standards right here in India by recovering resources, measuring environmental parameters, and making the manufacturing process more efficient. I can't wait to see technologies like these elevate the standards at which manufacturing facilities operate forever."},
